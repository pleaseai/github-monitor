// directly to native code — no Node.js process spawned on every invocation.
// Claude Code spawns the channel server on every session start, so this keeps
// the binary's ~5ms startup instead of paying Node boot + spawn each time. If
// anything fails (unsupported platform, missing optional dependency, read-only
// filesystem, or a package manager that skips lifecycle scripts), the JS shim
// stays in place and still works as a runtime fallback. This step is therefore
// best-effort and MUST exit 0.
//
// It is also idempotent: it only requires `lib/resolve.js` (never the shim it
// overwrites), so a repeated `npm rebuild` re-copies the binary cleanly instead
// of trying to `require()` a native executable as CommonJS.
